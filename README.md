# OpenGL Setup

##### GCC Compiler - MinGW

- Download the pre-package version for MinGW (freeglut 2.8.0 MinGW Package) available at http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/.
- Unzip
- copy header files from 
  - `include\GL` to  `MINGW_HOME>\include\GL` 
  - `lib` to `MINGW_HOME>\lib` 
  - shared library from `bin` to  `<MINGW_HOME>\bin`
